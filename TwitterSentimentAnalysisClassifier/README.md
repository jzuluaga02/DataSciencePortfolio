## Twitter Sentiment Analysis

In this comprehensive project, I conducted Sentiment Analysis on Twitter, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models from TensorFlow. The primary objective was to predict presidential election outcomes based on Twitter data, focusing on prominent figures such as Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the key contenders in the 2020 elections.

Extensive data mining was undertaken, scraping tweets from the main politicians from February 2020 through December 2020 for model training and subsequent testing. The findings revealed that while Twitter serves as a valuable tool for gauging general discourse and approval rates, its representation is not entirely inclusive of individuals from diverse backgrounds and age groups. This project underscored the nuanced reality that Twitter, while providing an approximate demonstration of public sentiment, does not fully encapsulate the breadth of perspectives present in real life.

● Constructed an automatic Twitter API scraper capable of retrieving up to 10.000 tweets weekly, doubling the size of the dataset employed for the training.

● Addressed dimensionality challenges among candidates by implementing data normalization techniques, ensuring equitable comparison through statistically sound methodologies.

● Built an LSTM sentiment classifier with 86% accuracy, offering a reliable alternative to traditional election surveys.

● Addressed the sarcasm limitation inherent in sentiment analysis classifiers by curating a dataset manually labeled by authentic users of the application. This dataset, comprising up to 5000 rows, yielded favorable results in detecting sarcasm within discourse.
