## Data Science Portfolio

I am Juan Manuel Zuluaga Fernandez, a Computer Science Master's candidate at Santa Clara University with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering from Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana. I'm passionate about data science, NLP, and software engineering.

This portfolio showcases my skills in NLP, Machine Learning and data analysis. Explore my projects and accomplishments as I navigate the tech world.



# Contents

* Sentiment Analysis Classifier on Twitter using LSTM
  * Description: Building a sentiment analysis classifier for Twitter, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The experiment was mostly conducting using the data of most followed politicians to see if Twitter actually reflects their approval rate and how they perform in presidential elections. 
  * Key Skills: Natural Language Processing, LSTM, Twitter API

* Fake News Detection Classifier using BERT - Transformers
  * Description: Developing a fake news detection classifier using BERT-based Transformers to distinguish between real and fake information on Twitter posted by the big accounts on this social media
  * Key Skills: Natural Language Processing, BERT, Transformers, Fake News Detection

* Network Traffic Exploratory Data Analysis using PySpark SQL
  * Description: Conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on network traffic data using PySpark SQL, including anomaly detection and insights generation.
  * Key Skills: PySpark SQL, EDA, Network Traffic Analysis
    
* Time Series Forecasting using LSTM
  * Description: Utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting, with a focus on applications like stock price prediction or weather forecasting.
  * Key Skills: Time Series Analysis, LSTM, Forecasting
    
# In Progress
I'm constantly learning and trying to come up with new ideas and projects that could help enhance my skills in Data Science, so I'm currently working in three new projects, trying to see if I can get good results with the data available to be scraped.

* Demand Forecasting: Predicting Future Ride Demand
  * Description: This project focuses on predicting future ride demand for Uber in specific regions and time periods. The goal is to provide accurate estimates of expected ride             requests, enabling Uber to efficiently allocate drivers to meet demand and reduce passenger wait times.
  * Key Skills: Time Series Analysis, Predictive Analytics, Geospatial Forecasting, Data Science, Machine Learning
 
* Object Recognition with Internet-Sourced Data (Phase 1)
  * Description: The first phase of this project involves training object recognition models using publicly available images from the internet. The objective is to develop a foundation       for a smart home surveillance system with object recognition capabilities.
  * Key Skills:
    * Data Collection and Preprocessing
    * Deep Learning Model Training
    * Real-time Object Recognition

* Mental Health Support Chatbot
  * Description: This project creates a chatbot capable of holding a conversation with a person struggling in their lives, suggesting solutions or encouraging people to ask for help if needed.
  * Key Skills:
    * Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    * Sentiment Analysis
    * Dialogue Generation
    * Text Classification
    * API Integration (for mental health resource connections)
    * Privacy and Data Security
