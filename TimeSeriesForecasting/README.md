## Time series forecasting for epidemics (Tuberculosis, Covid, Influenza, RSV)

This project delves into forecasting the dynamics of Tuberculosis (TB), Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in India. Notably, the analysis extends to Influenza and RSV dynamics, capturing the holistic health landscape. The project also incorporates outlier correction techniques to enhance data accuracy, especially during significant health events like the COVID-19 wave. This endeavor seeks to provide actionable insights for proactive public health strategies.

● Designed an advanced LSTM model for TB case prediction in India and major regions, achieving a 7% MAPE for short-term forecasts up to 4 weeks ahead.

● Implemented outlier correction techniques such as Z-score, MICE and predictive apparoach to enhance the robustness of the forecasting model decrementing the error rate by 16.6%

● addressed challenges associated with anomalies in the data, particularly during the significant drop in TB cases coinciding with the COVID-19 wave.

● Explored opportunities for refining the combined LSTM and XGBoost model, addressing challenges associated with outliers.

● Employed ensemble models to significantly improve forecasting accuracy, notably reducing MAPE from 11% for a 10-week ahead prediction to an impressive 8.33%.
