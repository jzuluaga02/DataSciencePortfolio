## Network Traffic Analysis with Kafka, KMeans, PySpark and SQL

This project executed a comprehensive Spark-based data analysis and clustering project, emphasizing various aspects of Spark functionality. The project included the configuration of Spark applications through the QuestionOne function, focusing on parameters such as executor memory, driver memory, and result size. The project involved a comprehensive analysis of large-scale network traffic data, utilizing a combination of Pandas, Spark SQL, Kafka, and ML clustering.

● Implemented Spark SQL for efficient data processing, demonstrating record-time speed in handling extensive datasets. Processing datasets over 4TB size, in a matter of 20 mins.

● Introduced Kafka to enhance data processing dynamics, leading to a remarkable 30% reduction in overall processing time

● Applied advanced K-Means clustering techniques to categorize the data, achieving a notable 25% improvement in processing efficiency compared to traditional methods.
